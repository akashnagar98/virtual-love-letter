        Dear [Your Crush's Name],

        Roses are red,
        Violets are blue,
        Sugar is sweet,
        And so are you.

        From the moment I met you, I knew you were special.
        Your smile lights up my world, and your laughter is music to my ears.

        Will you be my [girlfriend/boyfriend/partner]?

        With all my heart,
        [Your Name]
